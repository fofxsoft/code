# Code Editor
Inline code editor with ESLint based on VS Code.

## Building
You will need the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. The node install will include npm.

**Dependencies**

In the terminal navigate to the project folder.
```
$ cd code-editor
```

Then install the dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```

**Monaco**

In the terminal navigate to the monaco folder.
```
$ cd code-editor/monaco/
```

Then build monaco.
```
$ npm run build
```

**Editor**

In the terminal navigate to the editor folder.
```
$ cd code-editor/editor
```

Then build the editor.
```
$ npm run build
```

> The editor build process will copy over the build files to the build/editor folder. You should now have fresh files in the build folder.

## Installing
First copy the build/editor folder to your application. Then include the following in your HTML.

```html
<link href="editor/editor.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="editor/editor.js"></script>
```

## Usage
To include a code editor on your page, simply add the tag.

```html
<input type="editor" id="skywalker" name="skywalker" language="javascript" value="">
```

or

```html
<editor id="skywalker" name="skywalker" language="javascript"></editor>
```
